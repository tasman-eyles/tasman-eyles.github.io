        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I have learnt how to <strong>chill</strong> with the knowledge that I have, and not to stress because it will likely end up ok. Through <strong>mindfulness</strong> practice, 
          I feel like my mind is more compartmentalised and tidy. Mindfulness taught me how jumbled and tangled up my head was previously. I have also learnt how to <strong>productively study</strong> things with 
          the way we were taught to take breaks, and prioritize well-being, which will positively carry over to bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
          These 3 points are all very important in programming. Values help programmers use ethical practises whilst coding, empathy is an essential 
          quality any programmer needs to bring if they want to sucessfully work as a team and get a job, and self awareness is important as it helps coders and
          programmers see their strengths and weaknesses, so they can further refine their programming skills.
        </p>
        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          At first, I thought the core sections could be a waste of time, as I just wanted to crack into programming. But as the weeks past by, I came to the suprising realisation on just how essential the core study is
          to growth and learning. I was also suprised when I got to take a step back and look at my previous mindset. I am used to the "Just get s**t done" mindset, especially when it comes to the gym and nutrition. 
          But I was suprised to learn that yes, that mindset could work in theory, but it's not sustainable and I should take well-being into account.
        </p>
        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          It would have to be the identity-values and strengths blog we wrote. Not because it was physically hard to write, but more the fact that I was emotionally diving into my past and doing a complete self reflection on my life and how I ended
          up where I am today. I don't typically enjoy reminicing, because I will either think of good times and be disapointed that im past it, or think about something bad and get sad about it because it happened.  
        </p>
        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
          My theory would be that people skills are very important in the workforce as a developer, and you guys arn't just teaching us how to progaram, but also how to work well in a development enviroment with 
          other people. Another reason would have to be the 'Bootcamp' style, with long hours and intense challenges, placing strain on a students mind and ability. This makes the core learning and understanding of the mind vital to stay sane and healthy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h2>
        <p>
          No, I take core as a bit of a break from bombarding my brain with new information, and is refining my reflection skills and respecting my well-being. It also gives me a sense 
          of care within the course, and shows me that I am in good hands when it comes to the learning enviroment, as you guys care about my well-being and mental health.
