                <p>The Te Whare Tapa Wha is a model developed to provide a maori perspective on health and wellbeing. The model was developed by Tā Mason Durie in 1984. There are 4 dimensions to the Te Whare Tapa Wha model: </p>
              
                <ol>
                 <li>Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</li>
                  <li>Taha Hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</li>
                 <li>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</li>
                 <li>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</li>
                </ol>

              <p>The Te Whare Tapa Wha model points out the importance of harmony between these 4 dimensions (walls of the whare) and how they relate to human wellbeing, physical and mental.</p>

              <h3 class="custom-font" id="center"> How I will incorperate Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing) into my plan</h3>
              <p>Walking to the gym 6-7 days a week to complete an intensive gym session, comprehensively keeping track of nutrition and macros, along with getting adequate and optimal rest and recovery.</p>
              
              <h3 class="custom-font" id="center">How I will incorperate Taha Hinengaro (mental wellbeing) into my plan </h3>
              <p>Nutrition goes hand in hand with the physical well-being dimension, aswell as mental. I will comprehensively be keeping track of nutrition and macros, aswell as using the gym to reduce stress and anxiety. It does this by providing me with an outlet. And of course, mindfulness.. daily.</p>
              
              <h3 class="custom-font" id="center">How I will incorperate Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing) into my plan</h3>
              <p>For my Taha Wairua, I enjoy philosophizing in my head, as one of my common traits is having very analytical deep thoughts on my surroundings and enviroment at any given moment. This intensifys my connection with the universe.</p>
      
              <h3 class="custom-font" id="center">How I will incorperate Taha Whānau (family wellbeing) into my plan</h3>
              <p>I enjoy watching shows or movies with my parents sometiems, and have plenty of conversations with my best friend which often deepens our relationship and my personal sense of belonging.</p>
              
              <h3 class="custom-font" id="center">Whenua (land)</h3>
              <p>I enjoy walking home from the gym at night, looking up at the trees and taking in the bird chatter and trees waving in the wind. I also often sit outside and prune/water my bonsai trees, which is one of my favourite activitys to partake in to deepen my connection with nature.</p>
