        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
        <p>
          As discussed in the introduction video, the understanding of neuroplasticity can be used to favor recovery from injuries or illnesses, like strokes.
          If someone has an understanding of neuroplasticity, they can use it to their advantage by letting it encourage learning and skill development throughout their lives.
          The power of neuroplasticity also goes as far as to provide strategies to recover from mental health issues and strengthen resilience. It does this by highlighting the mind's ability to adapt and grow from experiences, and it can encourage people to make healthy decisions, like going to see a theorist, for example.
          Another interesting example of the benefits of understanding neuroplasticity would be its ability to enhance performance in physical and mental domains. For example, your ability to play instruments or to gain muscular strength, just by practicing in your mind.</p>
        
        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center"> how I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit</h2>
        <p>I will personally engage with the principles of neuroplasticity to increase my learning ability during this course. Even just knowing of its existence and having a decent understanding of what it is helps. “ <i>Researchers Lisa Blackwell of Columbia University and Kali Trzesniewski and Carol Dweck of Stanford University published a study in the journal Child Development in 2007 that found that both morale and grade points leapt when students understood intelligence is malleable. Not only did those students who already believed this do better in school, but when researchers actively taught the idea to a group of students, they performed significantly better than their peers in a control group.</i> ” I will engage with daily mindfulness, a balanced diet, a habitual gym routine, and avoiding harmful substances to support and optimize my personal brain health and neuroplasticity gains.</p>
        
        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>Practise, practise, practise. Read this analogy for example - The more cars on a road going one way is going to need more lanes and maintainance than a small road with hardly any traffic. This goes for electrochemical pathways in the brain connecting neurons too. By mentally thinking a thought, practicing an exercise, weather that be a physical or mental practice, the thicker and more abundant that pathway that makes that thought happen becomes. </p>

        <p>To be completely honest, just watching this Introduction Video was absoloutly facinating when watching for the first time. Brains arn’t typically a daily thought for me ironically, so an interesting watch.</p>

        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">What is a Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?</h2>
        <p>The growth mindset is where those with it believe that when facing obsticles, there is room for constant inprovement and development of their abilities. This opposes a fixed mindset, where people with this believe their intelligence, abilities, and talents are all just fixed traits, like having a cap</p>
        
        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">In this exploration, did anything surprise me? Change for me?</h2>
        <p>Everything psychologist Carol Dweck said in her Ted Talk seemed perfectly reasonable and wasn’t mush of a suprise. Although when she backed her claims up with evidence, I was suprised with just how prevelent the difference is between a growth and fixed mindset.</p>

        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h2>
        <p>I will always look at learning curves that I don’t quite understand with the word “Yet”. I believe this will drive me to learn and give me hope that the material is acheivable.</p>

        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">Link to a resource that I found particularly useful and engaging</h2>
        <p id="center">Here is the link to psychologist Carol Dweck’s Ted Talk:</p>

        <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">Blend with my learning plan and strategies</h2>
        <h4 class="custom-font" id="center">Reflecting and discussing how these understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy.</h4>
        <p>These two research topics, neuroplasticity and the growth mindset, will definitly follow me through this course and beyond, with my approach to learning. Knowing about neuroplasticity’s relevency in the learning process, along with how far a growth mindset can get you opposed to a fixed mindet is truely interesting, and has became a benifitial aspect of my learning plan strategy. I am definitly going to look at obsticles that i may fail with the word “Yet” insead of “I can’t”  and self doubt from now on, as it will drive me to strive for the answer. Also knowing about neuroplasticity has and will develop my understanding of the learning process and how powerful a simple thought is.</p>
