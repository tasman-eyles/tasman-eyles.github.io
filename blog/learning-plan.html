      What is my long-term goal or career pathway?
    </h2>

    <p class="para-margin" id="center">
      This point hasn't changed since I last covered it on bootcamp, sprint 2. I
      would still like to use the skills I learn from this course to land
      something more like cybersecurity, maybe game development on the side,
      and/or make an impact in the world of AI, too. I would like to travel
      around the world as I develop aswell, as I know that is possible while in
      this line of work which is awesome!
    </p>

    <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">
      My strengths and limitations predictions for bootcamp
    </h2>
    <p class="para-margin" id="center">
      My <strong>strengths</strong> are my focus, determination, and commitment
      to my future career. These havent changed. These will certainly help
      during bootcamp, and staying sane. My <strong>limitations</strong> still
      can be my time management skills, as discribed in my foundations learning
      plan. I have additionally discovered that I can get stressed when I can't
      figure something out, and if I spend too long on a challenge, I get
      anxious. I also worry if I know enouph, and have an annoying critical
      voice in my head that questions if I am cut out for finishing and
      succeeding this course. These will negitively impact bootcamp for me if I
      do not adress them appropriately which I plan to do, and may hinder my
      efficiency and well-being.
    </p>

    <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">
      What do I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
    </h2>

    <p class="para-margin" id="center">
      I think it will be time management, stress/anxiety, and the new routine. I
      feel like my time management limitations may stress me out, since 60 hours
      a week is a lot to manage. I worry that I will also be stressed/anxious
      about completing the course, yet alone each individual weeks challenge
      material. The new routine will also be a major change that I will have to
      get used to, which may stress me out a little bit.
    </p>

    <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>

    <p class="para-margin" id="center">
      Based on my strengths and limitations (limitations in particular), I would
      like my time management skills to be adiquite and managable for a real
      world job. I would also like to see my stress and anxiety management
      skills develop, as this will also help with my general life, too.
      Additionally, I would like to see myself develop good people skills as to
      replicate them in a work enviroment in the future.

      A description of what I expect from the bootcamp team
    </h2>
     
    <p class="para-margin" id="center">
      I expect the team to be pleasant and nice to talk to. I also expect them
      to be easy to work with, and easy to ask for help, and be accesable. FYI,
      I also still enjoy the eye level approach the foundations facilitators
      have presented, too.

      A discription of what I expect from myself during bootcamp
    </h2>

    <p class="para-margin" id="center">
      I expect myself to not faf around, and get the work done when I'm supposed
      to. I will do this by keeping composed and as stress free as possible,
      being approachable for other students. I will also try my best to not let
      bootcamp effect my gym and nutrition routine, as if this becomes
      unbalenced, my stress levels will be effected. This loops into keeping my
      well-being in check. For example, getting enough sleep, which can be
      challenging when I am stressed. I am also going to treat everyone
      (students and facilitators) like I am their friend and/or close work
      buddy, because one of my plans on bootcamp is to get close with people and
      make friends. I am also going to keep an open mind for anyone to critique
      my learning style, as this is important to grow within a workspace and
      community. Lastly, I will also have my discord notifications on in
      bootcamp, as this has become a prevelent issue in foundations. On the
      technical side of things, one way I will manage my workload, is by
      effectively utalizing what I have learnt boot
      <a href="problem-solving.html"><strong>here</strong></a> when
      trouble-shooting and solving issues. You can reffer to my
      <strong>foundations problem solving process</strong> below too, as I go
      into more detail on how I want to solve technical problems.

        What is my long-term goal or career pathway?

      <p class="para-margin" id="center">
        I would like to successfully finish my work here, land a job somewhere,
        and continue to develop my education within the wonderful world of
        software development. I don't know exactly what job I want (e.g. Cyber
        security, Game Dev), but my plan is that I will find what I enjoy
        throughout the process and know what I want when the time comes. Tech
        has always appealed to me. from a young age where I thought the command
        line and code looked super awesome, to now where I still think it looks
        awesome, but I want to understand it and build a career out of it. I
        love where the advancements of technology are going and the mind-blowing
        discoveries that seem to be a daily occurrence in 2024.

        A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      </h2>
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">
        My <strong>strengths</strong> are my focus, determination, and
        commitment. When I get fixed on completing something, I hardly get
        distracted, and when I do get distracted, it's usually just a sign that
        I have been working for a while and I need a break. These values shine
        through more when I know they are going towards my future.
      </p>
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">
        My <strong>limitations</strong> can be my time management skills. I
        sometimes underestimate the work needed to be put into an assignment or
        piece of learning material, which can lead to me getting stressed and
        anxious when trying to hit a deadline, or I end up rushing through and
        not learning effectively.

      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">
        The skills (non-technical core/human skills) I would like to see
        developed in myself while at Dev Academy
      </h2>
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">
        Time management is one of my learning limitations and something that I
        want to see improve over the coming months at Dev Academy. I would also
        like to see my level of resilience increase so that I do not get
        stressed out when I get something wrong, but rather stay positive. I
        would also like improvement in my problem-solving skills here at the dev
        academy. I know that in this line of work, problem solving is one of the
        biggest bullet points of coding and programming. There is endless
        improvement to be made to problem solving, further benefiting your
        coding skills, so of course I would like to see improvement. In summary,
        I want to be able to work efficiently while under stress, manage my time
        better, and deal with the silly critical voice in my head in a positive
        manor.
      </p>
       
      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">
        A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this program
      </h2>

       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">
        I will work productively and efficiently with others by developing my
        time management skills, using good communication skills and emotional
        intelligence, critical thinking in stressful situations, and taking
        little brain breaks to stay vigil and mentally sane during the course. I
        would also like to form a bond or relationship with my peers and
        facilitators, as I feel this is important for everybody's comfort with
        each other under stressful conditions. When things in DA start to get to
        me, like workload, I will plan in a document or notepad how I will
        effectively achieve completion of the work. This not only helps by
        planning my work, but I also enjoy getting plans out of my head and onto
        paper, so I stop going in circles in my head and stressing. Another
        tactic that I have used for the past couple years that has a very high
        success rate in calming me down is the gym. I treat the gym as my
        outlet, and it doubles as my passion, so it's the perfect mental and
        physical escape from my room, too.

      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">
        A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way (My
        problem-solving process)
      </h2>

      <p class="para-margin" id="center">
        When I go about solving problems, I first go through the
        methods/techniques I know in hopes of solving the problem (Discribed in
        detail
        <a href="problem-solving.html"><strong>here</strong></a
        >). If nothing works, I take to the internet, either discribing the
        problem at hand or pasting the error message into the searchbar and
        preferably looking for a 'Stack Overflow' URL to check out (basically
        just a forum to post programming problems, errors, or bugs). If I can't
        find a solution there, I just search around other parts of the internet
        and go to ChatGPT. I also go to Discord often, as it is rare to not find
        your answers there. This process almost always works, but if I get
        really stuck, I'll have a short break, come back to it, and repeat my
        problem-solving process. If I were seriously in a time crunch, though,
        my best bet is the Discord channel, of course.

        A description of what I expect from the facilitation team
      </h2>
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">
        I expect to be responded to efficiently (at reasonable hours 9–5), and
        if I am stuck, I expect the answers to guide me in the right direction.
        I am also expecting the facilitators to be nice and pleasant to talk to
        (so far they have) and keep up the eye-level, down-to-earth approach
        they have had so far (I like the non-serious approach).

      <p class="para-margin" id="center">
        I am completely commitment-free for the next 3 months during the day,
        But I would like to still fit in the gym and nutrition 6 days a week. If
        anything spontaneously pops up, I am sure to alert the team efficiently.
