    <body>
   
      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">What is my long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
 
      <p class="para-margin " id="center">I would like to successfully finish my work here, land a job somewhere, and continue to develop my education within the wonderful world of software development. I don't know exactly what job I want (e.g., cyber security, consignment), but my plan is that I will find what I enjoy throughout the process and know what I want when the time comes. Tech has always appealed to me. from a young age where I thought the command line and code looked super awesome, to now where I still think it looks awesome, but I want to understand it and build a career out of it. I love where the advancements of technology are going and the mind-blowing discoveries that seem to be a daily occurrence in 2024.</p>
       
      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center"> A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">My strengths are my focus, determination, and commitment. When I get fixed on completing something, I hardly get distracted, and when I do get distracted, it's usually just a sign that I have been working for a while and I need a break. These values shine through more when I know they are going towards my future.</p>
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">My limitations can be my time management skills. I sometimes underestimate the work needed to be put into an assignment or piece of learning material, which can lead to me getting stressed and anxious when trying to hit a deadline, or I end up rushing through and not learning effectively.</p>
       
      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">The skills (non-technical core/human skills) I would like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy</h2>
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">Time management is one of my learning limitations and something that I want to see improve over the coming months at Dev Academy. I would also like to see my level of resilience increase so that I do not get stressed out when I get something wrong, but rather stay positive. I would also like improvement in my problem-solving skills here at the dev academy. I know that in this line of work, problem solving is one of the biggest bullet points of coding and programming. There is endless improvement to be made to problem solving, further benefiting your coding skills, so of course I would like to see improvement.</p>
       
      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this program</h2>
      
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">I will work productively and efficiently with others by developing my time management skills, using good communication skills and emotional intelligence, critical thinking in stressful situations, and taking little brain breaks to stay vigil and mentally sane during the course. I would also like to form a bond or relationship with my peers and facilitators, as I feel this is important for everybody's comfort with each other under stressful conditions.
      When things in DA start to get to me, like workload, I will plan in a document or notepad how I will effectively achieve completion of the work. This not only helps by planning my work, but I also enjoy getting plans out of my head and onto paper, so I stop going in circles in my head and stressing. Another tactic that I have used for the past couple years that has a very high success rate in calming me down is the gym. I treat the gym as my outlet, and it doubles as my passion, so it's the perfect mental and physical escape from my room, too.</p>
       
      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">When I go about solving problems, I first go through the stuff I know in hopes of solving the problem. If nothing works, I take to the internet, either discribing the problem at hand or pasting the error message into the searchbar and preferably looking for a 'Stack Overflow' URL to check out (basically just a forum to post programming problems, errors, or bugs). If I can't find a solution there, I just search around other parts of the internet and go to ChatGPT. I also go to Discord often, as it is rare to not find your answers there. This process almost always works, but if I get really stuck, I'll have a short break, come back to it, and repeat my problem-solving process. If I were seriously in a time crunch, though, my best bet is the Discord channel, of course.</p>
       
       
      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">A description of what I expect from the facilitation team</h2>
       
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">I expect to be responded to efficiently (at reasonable hours 9–5), and if I am stuck, I expect the answers to guide me in the right direction. I am also expecting the facilitators to be nice and pleasant to talk to (so far they have) and keep up the eye-level, down-to-earth approach they have had so far (I like the non-serious approach).</p>
       
      <h2 class="custom-font" id="center">scheduling information</h2>
      
      <p class="para-margin" id="center">I am completely commitment-free for the next 3 months, but if anything spontaneously pops up, I am sure to alert the team efficiently.</p>
